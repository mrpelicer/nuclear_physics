This code currently calculates the equation of state for the non-linear walecka model in a variety of situations:

With density loops:

(1) For nucleons w/ fixed proton fraction and temperature in the folder:
"np_fixed_proton_fraction"

(2) For charge neutral (npe) w/ fixed proton fraction and temperature in the folder:
"npe_fixed_proton_fraction"

(3) For (un)magnetized baryonic matter with or without amm's. One can choose the families in the calculation (nucleons, hyperons and  delta isobars) in beta-equilibrium (ONLY T=0):
"nyd_betaEq_bfield_amm"

(4) Same as (3) but with 
nydem_betaEq_bfield_amm: nucleons+hyperons+deltas+electrons+muons
