This code is being build during my doctorate to calculate various quantities within the non-linear walecka model, such as:

(1) The equation of state for baryons (nucleons, hyperons, deltas)in beta-equilibrium. It is possible to include  magnetic fields and/or magnetic moments, but only at T=0 for now. 

(2) The EoS for nucleons w/ fixed proton fraction at any temperature temperature.

(3) EoS and radius of the nuclear pasta, w/ fixed proton fraction or beta-equilibrium at any temperature.

(4) EoS, stability window and phase diagram of density and temperature dependent quark mass model matter.
